heroku-buildpack-vips
=====================

A VIPS buildpack for the modern Heroku stacks. This stack supports the following
stacks:

- heroku-18
- heroku-20
- heroku-22

If you have problems on any of these stacks, or if a new stack comes out that is
unsupported, please file an issue.

If you would like to use heroku-16, the last version which supported that stack
is tagged "heroku-16".

Important notes:

This buildpack started out as one of the many that are out there, and ended up
being completely different. The build script uses docker and also includes pdf
support via poppler. In order to use this buildpack, you must install these packages in your heroku application:

- libglib2.0-0
- libglib2.0-dev
- libpoppler-glib8

Additionally, if you are planning to use [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), you may also need the following packages:
- libpoppler-glib-dev
- libheif-dev
- libfftw3-dev
- libwebp-dev

The easiest way to do this is using the heroku apt buildpack.

This buildpack was put together with the help of John Cupitt, the creator of
libvips. He was invaluable in my efforts to get a working libvips installation
with pdf support on heroku. Thank you John!

Heroku buildpack with [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) installed.


## Usage

To use this on Heroku it must be installed with the required dependencies in the required order. We must first add the [apt buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt) so that it is executed first. We can do that with the following Heroku CLI command:

```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
```

Once added, you'll need to make sure that you create a file called `Aptfile` in the root of your project. The contents of this file need to be:

```
libglib2.0-0
libglib2.0-dev
libpoppler-glib8
```

These are dependencies required for this buildpack.

We can then add this buildpack by running:

```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 https://github.com/brandoncc/heroku-buildpack-vips
```

After running this command you should see the output similar to:

```
Buildpack added. Next release on amazing-earthfest will use:
  1. heroku-community/apt
  2. https://github.com/brandoncc/heroku-buildpack-vips
  3. heroku/ruby
```

The order is important as the `apt` buildpack and its dependencies must be installed before this buildpack. Finally the buildpack specifc to your application (in this case its the ruby buildpack) can be installed.

## Build script

[This](./build.sh) is the script used to build vips using docker.

```sh
HEIF_VERSION=1.16.1 VIPS_VERSION=8.14.2 ./build.sh
```

After building a tar file, it will be copied to the `build` directory. Then you should commit this changes to git.

## Build configurations

If you would like to see the output of `vips --vips-version` or `vips --vips-config`, both can be found for each stack in the [build/configurations](build/configurations) directory. These configuration logs are generated automatically during the build process, so they should always be up-to-date.
